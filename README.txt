Hello! My name is Nick Doxa and I am currently in the process of applying for a position on your team as a Developer.
My skill set is broad however I wanted to make one central project to display my knowledge and capabilities since most of my projects from minecraft are simply old and do not accurately depict my skill level.
To explain the gap in time, I took a break from coding for spigot, bukkit, etc. because I was in my first semester of college and needed to work on my classes however now I am ready to work!
In this project you will find:
- A Main class that connects everything within the plugin and acts as the initializing class for the plugin
- Multiple different API integrations and examples to show my wide knowledge and skills of not only spigot, bukkit, etc. but also other industry standard API's!
- Clean and organized code
- Correct use of access modifiers and a solid foundation in Java
- Single Resource Purpose understanding in the code
- OOP Understanding in the code
- Correct implication of bukkit protocols
- And much more!
Thank you for your time and consideration!
Sincerely, Nick Doxa.
